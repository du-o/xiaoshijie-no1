In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations.

In practice, such tables are often interpreted manually by human experts, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, automating this process remains difficult. Exi",
