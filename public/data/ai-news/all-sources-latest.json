      "summary": "arXiv:2602.23367v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers contain a collection of thousands of open-source standardized tools, linking LLMs to external systems; however, existing datasets and benchmarks lack realistic, human-like user queries, remaining a critical gap in evaluating the tool usage and ecosystems of MCP servers. Existing datasets often do contain tool descriptions but fail to represent how different users portray their requests, leading to poor generaliz",

Traditional approaches rely on keyword-based searches that generate high false-positive rates or require extensive manual review. We present an agentic system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate adverse media screening. Our system imp",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.23545v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In the real world, planning is often challenged by distribution shifts. As such, a model of the environment obtained under one set of conditions may no longer remain valid as the distribution of states or the environment dynamics change, which in turn causes previously learned strategies to fail. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for planning under partial observability using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) fo",

In the min-max variant, the objective is to minimize the longest tour, reflecting workload balance.
