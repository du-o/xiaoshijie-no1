      "date": "Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT",
      "summary": "arXiv:2602.11159v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explai",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.11229v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to co",

A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces.
