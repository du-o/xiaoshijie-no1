      "summary": "arXiv:2602.17676v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models and AI agents across critical societal and technical domains is hindered by persistent behavioral pathologies including sycophancy, hallucination, and strategic deception that resist mitigation via reinforcement learning. Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these",

I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with h",

Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-cent",
