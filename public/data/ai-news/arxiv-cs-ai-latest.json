      "summary": "arXiv:2602.18494v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.18582v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: When training artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks, humans often care not only about whether a task is completed but also how it is performed. As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learn",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.18607v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a w",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.18640v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modern large-scale ranking systems operate within a sophisticated landscape of competing objectives, operational constraints, and evolving product requirements. Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.18671v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We reinterpret the final Large Language Model (LLM) softmax classifier as an Energy-Based Model (EBM), decomposing the sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs at inference. This principled approach allows us to track \"energy spills\" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently ",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.18710v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst\" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fu",
