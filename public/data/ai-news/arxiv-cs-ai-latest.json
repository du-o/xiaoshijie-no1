      "title": "LLM-FSM: Scaling Large Language Models for Finite-State Reasoning in RTL Code Generation",
      "date": "Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT",
      "summary": "arXiv:2602.07032v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Finite-state reasoning, the ability to understand and implement state-dependent behavior, is central to hardware design. In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually co",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.07034v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Semi-structured table question answering (QA) is a challenging task that requires (1) precise extraction of cell contents and positions and (2) accurate recovery of key implicit logical structures, hierarchical relationships, and semantic associations encoded in table layouts. In practice, such tables are often interpreted manually by human experts, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, automating this process remains difficult. Exi",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.07035v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated unique efficiency advantages, enabled by their inherently parallel decoding mechanism and flexible generation paradigm. Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.07040v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce Aster, an AI agent for autonomous scientific discovery capable of operating over 20 times faster than existing frameworks. Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to in",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.07055v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Spatial embodied intelligence requires agents to act to acquire information under partial observability. While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, part",
