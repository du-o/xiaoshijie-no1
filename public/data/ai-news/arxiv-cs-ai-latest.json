      "summary": "arXiv:2602.20303v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Background: Childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity remain major public health concerns in the United States and are shaped by behavioral, household, and community factors. Their joint predictive structure at the population level remains incompletely characterized. Objectives: The study aims to identify multilevel predictors of overweight and obesity among U.S. adolescents and compare the predictive performance, calibration, and subgroup eq",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.20324v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Phenotyping is fundamental to rare disease diagnosis, but manual curation of structured phenotypes from clinical notes is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically in",

In Phase I, a large language model proposes a sparse draft DAG, serving as a semantically informed prior over the space of possible causal structures. In Phase II, this draft is audited and refined via conditional independence testing, with detected d",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.20422v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising capabilities in trajectory generation for planning in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, conventional diffusion-based planning methods often fail to account for the fact that generating trajectories in RL requires unique consistency between transitions to ensure coherence in real environments. This oversight can result in considerable discrepancies between the generated trajectories and the underlyin",

Natural human communication relies on shared context and unstated constraints that speakers expect listeners to infer. Current agentic benchmarks test explicit instruction-following but fail to evaluate whether agents can reason about implicit requirements spanning accessibility needs, privacy boundaries, catastrophic risks, and contextual constraints.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.20426v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The performance of LLM-based agents depends not only on the agent itself but also on the quality of the tool interfaces it consumes. While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely ",
