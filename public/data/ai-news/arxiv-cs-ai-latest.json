      "summary": "arXiv:2602.23367v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers contain a collection of thousands of open-source standardized tools, linking LLMs to external systems; however, existing datasets and benchmarks lack realistic, human-like user queries, remaining a critical gap in evaluating the tool usage and ecosystems of MCP servers. Existing datasets often do contain tool descriptions but fail to represent how different users portray their requests, leading to poor generaliz",

Traditional approaches rely on keyword-based searches that generate high false-positive rates or require extensive manual review. We present an agentic system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate adverse media screening. Our system imp",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.23541v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Previous work establishing completeness results for $\\textit{counterfactual identification}$ has been circumscribed to the setting where the input data belongs to observational or interventional distributions (Layers 1 and 2 of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy), since it was generally presumed impossible to obtain data from counterfactual distributions, which belong to Layer 3. However, recent work (Raghavan & Bareinboim, 2025) has formally characterized a",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.23545v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In the real world, planning is often challenged by distribution shifts. As such, a model of the environment obtained under one set of conditions may no longer remain valid as the distribution of states or the environment dynamics change, which in turn causes previously learned strategies to fail. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for planning under partial observability using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) fo",

In the min-max variant, the objective is to minimize the longest tour, reflecting workload balance. We propose a hybrid approach, Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt with Reinforcement Learning (RL-CMSA), for the symmetric single-depot min-max mTSP. The method iteratively con",

Despite the critical role of sleep, learning-based sleep analysis systems operate in closed label spaces (e.g., predefined stages or events) and fail to describe, query, or generalize to novel sleep phenomena. SleepLM bridges natural language and multimodal polysomnography, enabling language-grou",
